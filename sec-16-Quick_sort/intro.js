//          QUICK SORT

//   this is a intermediate level algorithm

/*
this is used in case of recursion calls

Works by selecting one element (called the "pivot point")
and finding the index where the pivot should end up in the sorted array

Once the pivot is positioned appropriately, quick sort
can be applied on either side of the pivot
