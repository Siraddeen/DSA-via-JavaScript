/*   Intermediate Sorting Algorithms


 merge sort
 quick sort
 radix sort

/*
merge sort is faster than  bubble sort 
if we have a array of 120000 value  it would take 25 sec in bubble sort
& 1 sec in merge sort



FASTER SORTS

1)There is a family of sorting algorithms that can
    improve time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n)

2)There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity

3)The more efficient algorithms are much less simple,
    and generally take longer to understand
